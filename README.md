Building a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

The PyChain Ledger structure using Proof Of Work consensus algorithm to make it slightly harder to add a block to the chain, also the consensus mechanisms was based on the hashcash algorithm to increase sercurity of the data.
